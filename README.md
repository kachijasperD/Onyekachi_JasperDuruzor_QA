So typically, I make use of Katalon Studio for my UI Automation test, however, since it was a requirement from the test scenario that the team is only proficient in Javascript and Python, I had to pick an alternative that is quite similar but slightly different in the mode of operation.

The UI Automation tool I decided to use is “Katalon Recorder” a google chrome extension, used for recording web UI. I chose Katalon Recorder because of its ability to export test script into different languages (as that’s an expectation for this test) and it can be used by other automation tools or IDEs.

Find the following files attached:
	Ormuco_PythonExport_QA_Test: folder contains testcase for an Invalid_User_credential test, test script exported in Python and Python2 files and logs of successful test run.

	Ormuco_QA_Test: A full project of an Invalid_User_credential test using Katalon studio. This is my preferred tool for UI, Andriod and IOS terminal test. I uploaded this just to show how both tools vary. Please note that this test script is in Groovy and was not converted to Python or javascript as expected.
